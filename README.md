# 🌟 My 30-Day Data Science Learning Journey

This repository is my personal tracker for learning data science in 30 days. It’s a self-paced challenge where I aim to cover the essential concepts and skills needed to dive into the field of data science. I'll document my progress, resources, code snippets, and projects here as I move through each day of the challenge.

## 🗓️ Plan

The goal is to make consistent progress every day by focusing on key topics like:

- 🐍 **Python Programming** for data manipulation and automation.
- 📊 **Pandas & NumPy** for working with data efficiently.
- 📈 **Data Visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand datasets.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Basics** including regression, classification, and clustering.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning** introduction with simple models.
- 📐 **Statistics & Probability** fundamentals.
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning** for preparing datasets.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

These are the tools and libraries I’m using along the way:

- **Python 3.x** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓
- **Pandas** 🐼
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📊
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖
