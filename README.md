My 30-Day Data Science Learning Journey
This repository is my personal tracker for learning data science in 30 days. It‚Äôs a self-paced challenge where I aim to cover the essential concepts and skills needed to dive into the field of data science. I'll document my progress, resources, code snippets, and projects here as I move through each day of the challenge.

üìÖ Plan
The goal is to make consistent progress every day by focusing on key topics like:

Python Programming for data manipulation and automation.
Pandas & NumPy for working with data efficiently.
Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand datasets.
Machine Learning Basics including regression, classification, and clustering.
Deep Learning introduction with simple models.
Statistics & Probability fundamentals.
Data Cleaning for preparing datasets.
Each day, I will:

Review resources (articles, videos, books).
Work through examples and write code.
Track what I've learned here.
üîç Tools & Libraries
These are the tools and libraries I‚Äôm using along the way:

Python 3.x for all coding tasks.
Jupyter Notebook to run my code.
Pandas for data manipulation.
NumPy for numerical computing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations.
Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
